MVP:

    WHAT     <foo> lists all available cassettes on bandcamp for a curated list of vaporwave music labels
    HOW      by automatically scraping the bandcamp label merch sites regularily
    FOR WHOM so that vaporwave cassette consumers
    VALUE    don't have to remember anymore who released what and when and
             don't have to check manually if there are still cassettes available.

Out of scope:
    formats other than cassettes
    labels other than vaporwave
    realtime release information
    custom sorting or filtering in UI

X label list
X for each label
X     for each album in merch
X         if "Cassette" and not "Sold out"
X             display
X               link to release
X               remaining number if present

X order by appearance date desc (most recents first)
X available cassettes asc (smallest number first)

detail info:
    X timestamp of scraping (last updated)

cards (fixed width per card, one card = mobile view)
max-width (120rem)
filter with label tags
    parent component
        filter bar
            update function (set state)
        grid


v1.1:
    sort by remaining number or release date
    filter by label (store in localstorage)
